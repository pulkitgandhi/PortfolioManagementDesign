We use Oracle Database for this application.

Make sure you include the function name and relation's name in front with "_" (underscore) when naming attributes.

For example, if you are naming the attribute ID of Client relation when you are inserting, name it as "ins_client_ID" (ins means INSERT). This makes it easier to identify which relation this ID is referring to when
you will eventually deal with many IDs later.
