# Investment Portfolio Management (Daniel Chan, Pulkit Gandhi, Yan Naing Win)

Our project revolves around the concept of an investment management firm. As a business that invests clients’ funds to return profits, our main focus is on storing the data in the customers’ portfolio. The benefit of having a database for this application is that we are able to store the client's portfolio, manager’s information and relationship between them as well as store the information of securities purchased by us such as the quantity and type of securities purchased.


A customer works with our company by creating one or more portfolios and add money using their bank accounts. In this way, we can receive a certain amount of funds that the client wants to invest. A customers’ portfolio consists of various securities that we invest on behalf of the clients. These include stocks and options that can return maximized profits to our customers.
 

The application is solely written for the business that will be managing these portfolios. Thus, all the operations involving the customers’ funds are solely managed by our certified portfolio managers, while customers are only allowed to view their portfolios. One or more managers are eligible to control a client’s portfolio to trade potential high-returning securities on a daily basis. These trades are completed by making orders which contain information about the date of purchase, amount purchased, and fulfillment price per unit of a security. All of these securities that we purchase are offered by trusted multinationals around the world and they are all listed on well-renowned stock exchanges. 

We will be working using CPSC department’s Oracle database system with HTML/PHP for the front end. We do not anticipate any additional hardware/software at this point in time.

ABOUT UPCOMING DEMO

In order to save time inserting all sample datasets during the demo, we will be inserting necessary datasets for our queries prior to the presentation. We will then carry out operations according to the lead TA's instructions.
